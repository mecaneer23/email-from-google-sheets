# Email from google sheets

The following worked for me to email a list of people from google sheets

1. Create associated Apps Script (Extensions -> Apps Script)
2. Paste Code.gs into the main editor
3. Edit the code to suit your needs
4. create a body.html with the body of the email you want to send
5. run the script (make sure you select the correct function to run)
